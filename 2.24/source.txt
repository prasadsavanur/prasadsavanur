One of the first things you probably do every morning is look out the window to see what the weather is like. 
Looking outside and listening to the day’s forecast helps you decide what clothes you will wear and maybe even what you will do throughout the day. 
If you don’t have school and the weather looks sunny, you might visit the zoo or go on a picnic. A rainy day might make you think about visiting a museum or staying home to read.The weather affects us in many ways. 
Day-to-day changes in weather can influence how we feel and the way we look at the world. Severe weather, such as tornadoes, hurricanes, and blizzards, can disrupt many people’s lives because of the destruction they cause.
The term “weather” refers to the temporary conditions of the atmosphere, the layer of air that surrounds the Earth. We usually think of weather in terms of the state of the atmosphere in our own part of the world.
